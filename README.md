**A word guessing game inspired by Wordle**

---
## ðŸ“‹ Overview

This project was made as a part of the Object-Oriented Programming-1 course to learn about OOP concepts,
graphical user interfaces and clean code guidelines through a practical approach.

**Key features:**

- Visual feedback based on letter position
- Warning pop-up for short words
- Score system based on the number of tries

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
To help individuals learn English words in an interactive and amazing way.
Also, to implement OOP concepts to build interactive desktop apps.

## ðŸŽ® How to play
After opening, you'll see 3 options:

- Play: Will let you play the game
- Help: Will give you instructions to play the game
- About: Will show you details about the developers

### General Rules

**You have to guess any five-letter word**

- If your guessed letter is in the correct position in the word, it will turn green.

- If it is in the word but in wrong position, it will turn yellow.

- If it is not in the word , it will be grey.
